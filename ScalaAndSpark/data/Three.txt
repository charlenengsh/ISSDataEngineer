A MODERN RENDITION OF THE TAMIL CLASSIC

Chapter 3 : Glory of those who have relinquished
The courageous duty of books should be to bring to the fore,
the glory of those with high values and have given up desire.	21
Trying to quantify the greatness of those who have overcome desire
is like counting those who have died till now.	22
The greatness of those, who have known both worlds
but have eschewed desire to live a simple life, is admirable.	23
The greatness of those, who have known both worlds
but have chosen to live a righteous life, makes this world meaningful.	23 V2
Using the ankus called resoluteness, one who controls
the elephant named five senses, is sowing for future glory.	24
God, the king of heavens, is an example of
what the ability to conquer oneâ€™s five senses can result in.	25
What separates the great from the ordinary
is their ability to do the seemingly impossible.	26
One who has analysed and conquered the urges of
taste, sight, touch, sound and smell, will control this world.	27
The words of those glorious people, who control their minds completely,
become the gospel.	28
Those who have scaled the mountain of morality
will not allow their anger to last for a moment.	29
Those who have scaled the altitudes of rectitude
will not hold their anger even for a second.	29 V2
All (and only) those righteous people, who shower love on all living beings,
can be classified as Brahmins.	30
