Chapter 1 : Invocation	
A is the first of the alphabet;
God is the primary force of the world.	1
What is the use of all your learning,
if you can’t surrender yourself at the feet of God.	2
Those who surrender themselves at feet of the one,
who resides in the flower-like hearts of all, will live long and well.	3
Those who surrender at the feet of the one,
who doesn’t have wants or hates, will never have any hassles anywhere.	4
Fate, which impacts those in the darkness of ignorance,
will not impede those who hail the true glory of God.	5
Those who follow the true moral path of the one,
who has doused the desires of the five senses, will last long.	6
Except for those who surrender at the feet of the one, for whom,
there is no simile, it is tough to cure the mental rues.	7
Except those who surrender at the feet of God, the ocean of morality,
others will struggle to cross the ocean of desire.	8
The head that doesn’t bow to God, is similar
to the organs that don’t have the right senses.	9
Those who surrender at the feet of God,
will cross the great ocean of life; others won’t.	10
